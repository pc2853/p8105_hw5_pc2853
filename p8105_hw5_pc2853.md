### Problem 1

-   Start with a dataframe containing all file names:

``` r
p1_file_name = 
  tibble(
    path = str_c("./data/", list.files("data/"))[1:20],
    name = list.files("data/")[1:20]
  )
```

-   Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe;
-   Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary:

``` r
add_arm_id_and_read = function(x){
  read_csv(x) %>% 
    mutate(arm = str_sub(x, 8, 10), id = str_sub(x, 12, 13))
  
}

p1_data_tidy = 
  map_df(.x = p1_file_name$path, ~ add_arm_id_and_read(.x)) %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = weekly_observation, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  separate(week, into = c("remove", "week"), sep = "_") %>% 
  select(arm, id, everything(), -remove)
```

-   Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups

``` r
p1_data_tidy %>% 
  mutate(arm_id = paste(arm, id, sep = "_")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = weekly_observation, color = arm, group = arm_id)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(
      title = "Observations on each subject over time",
      x = "Week",
      y = "Weekly observation",
      color = 'Arm'
    ) 
```

Reading this plot, we know that the observations in experimental arm in generally larger than that in control arm, and only the experimental arm has increasing observations over time.

### Problem 2

-   Import the data:

``` r
p2_data = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

-   describe the data:

The data has a dimension of 52179, 12. It contains variables that are victims' id, reported date, victims' last name, victims' first name, their race, age, sex, city, state, latitude, longitude and disposition.

-   Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”):

``` r
p2_data_mutated_total = 
  p2_data %>%
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(n_homicide_total = n())

p2_data_mutated_unsolved = 
  p2_data %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) %>% 
  filter(disposition == c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(n_homicide_unsolved = n())
```

    ## Warning in disposition == c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"):
    ## longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

``` r
p2_data_mutate = 
  full_join(p2_data_mutated_total, p2_data_mutated_unsolved) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(n_homicide_unsolved) == TRUE)
```

    ## Joining, by = "city_state"

-   For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe:

``` r
p2_data_Baltimore_MD =   
  p2_data_mutate %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
prop.test(p2_data_Baltimore_MD$n_homicide_unsolved, p2_data_Baltimore_MD$n_homicide_total) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

|  estimate|  conf.low|  conf.high|
|---------:|---------:|----------:|
|     0.325|     0.308|      0.343|

-   Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city:

``` r
prop_test_unsolved = function(x){
  p2_data_each_city =   
  p2_data_mutate %>% 
  filter(city_state == x)
  
  prop.test(p2_data_each_city$n_homicide_unsolved, p2_data_each_city$n_homicide_total) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
  
}

p2_data_mutated_unsolved_prop = 
  p2_data_mutate %>% 
  mutate(unsolved_prop = map(.x = city_state, ~ prop_test_unsolved(.x))) %>% 
  unnest()
p2_data_mutated_unsolved_prop
```

-   Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out geom\_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved homicides:

``` r
p2_data_mutated_unsolved_prop %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate, ymax = conf.high, ymin = conf.low)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(
    title = "The estimates and CIs of the proportion of unsolved homicides",
    x = "City and state",
    y = "Proportion estimate"
  )
```
